## My solve

The compass direction tells us that the location is towards the north of the mountain. In our image we can see the highly distinctive japanese cemetries and the description of the challenge also
hints to us that it is possibly near a Buddhist temple. We can also see some cherry blossoms and a residental area along with a forested hill.

I then entered all this information along with the image to a location analyzer which predicted the area to be in Yamanashi.

On using the satelite view of google maps and going through every temple along the forested region in Yamanashi, we find our temple in Narusawa.

Then we use the street view feautre and roam around the region to finally find our required location.
